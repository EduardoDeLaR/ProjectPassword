## Setup

The TypeLock security protocol is implemented on the server side of a web application. To use TypeLock, you must have an account on a website that supports the TypeLock security protocol.

## Getting Started

To use TypeLock, you must have an account on a website that supports the TypeLock security protocol. If you're not sure whether a particular website supports TypeLock, check with the website's support team or documentation.

### Prerequisites

- Git
- Github
- Supported web browser

### Installing

Once you have an account on a TypeLock enabled website, follow these steps to set up TypeLock for your account:

1. Navigate to the account settings or security settings page.
2. Look for an option to enable TypeLock, and follow the instructions to set up your typing style dataset.
3. Once your typing style dataset is set up, you can log in to your account using TypeLock.

Note: TypeLock is implemented on the server side of a web application, so there is no separate software or application to install.

## Usage

To log in to your account with TypeLock, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the login page of the website
2. Type the reference phrase using your unique typing style
3. TypeLock compares the typing style used to type the reference phrase to your previously created Typing Style Dataset.
4. If the typing style matches, you will be granted access to your account. If it does not match, you will be denied access.

To create or reset your Typing Style Dataset, follow these steps:

1. Select the "Create Typing Style Dataset" or "Reset Typing Style Dataset" option from the website.
2. The website generates a reference phrase of moderate length for you to type.
3. Type the reference phrase a specific number of times.
4. Typelock compiles the input statistics from each repetition into a dataset attributed to you.
5. The new Typing Style Dataset is saved for future use in logging into your accounts.
