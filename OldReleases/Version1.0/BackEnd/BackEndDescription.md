# TypeLock: Back-end

Team: Brock Heinz and Michael Vertin

## Description

The Back-end team will develop an algorithm in C++ that can compare two lists of keypresses with their corresponding times. Two types of errors can be found: spelling error, and the ratio of the average time delay differences. Constants are used to determine if the input matches the previous record of the user's typing style.

## Notes

The algorithm for string comparison has been uploaded to the Github repository.
