## 1. System Description

As the uses for the internet expand and broaden, many internet users struggle to remember multiple passwords for their various accounts. This can be time-consuming and compromise account security. TypeLock is a secure account login system that addresses this issue by using typing metrics, such as speed and accuracy, to identify users without the need for a dedicated password. Unlike traditional password-based systems, which require exact memorization and input of short passwords for each account, TypeLock relies on the user's ability to type a given phrase or paragraph that they have previously seen, allowing them to be identified via their typing metrics. This approach makes it easy for internet users to log in to their accounts without the need to memorize multiple passwords or dig through a password list or file, as their typing metrics serve as a unique identifier. TypeLock is an ideal solution for individuals who have difficulty remembering their passwords and need a more convenient and secure way to access their online accounts.

The primary requirements of the system are to create and offer a secure and reliable login process that is easy for users to use and enhances their account security. To meet these requirements, the system must accurately and efficiently identify users based on their typing metrics, such as speed and accuracy, while also allowing users to set up and manage their typing style datasets easily. The system is composed of three main sections: Back-end, Front-end, and a Client Server relationship. The system uses back-end algorithms to correctly identify users by their typing style, ensuring that users can log in to their accounts while preventing unauthorized access. Moreover, the Back-end's algorithm can compare two lists of keypresses with their corresponding times. Two types of errors can be found: spelling error, and the ratio of the average time delay differences. Constants are used to determine if the input matches the previous record of the user's typing style. The Front-end designs the user interface, developes the reference passphrase for the user to enter, and the algorithm through which the user's input is captured for processing. The Client and Server are the key components that integrate the Front-end designs and data with the back-end algorithm. It's important to note that the front end is written in python and the Back-end utilizes C++. The main difference between these two languages is how they utilize endianness. Python stores integers using the endianness of the processor that is running the program as does C++. This becomes a problem for passing data if the two end hosts use different endian storage systems. To avoid this we will need to do conversions on the client and server side before passing any information between the Client Server connection.

The system consists of ten classes that work together to provide a secure and easy-to-use login method: **User**, **Dataset**, **Login**, **Keyboard**, **Device**, **TypeLock**, **Back-end**, **Front-end**, **Client-Server**, and **Reference Phrase**. The **User** class represents individuals who use the system to log in to their accounts. The **User** class has attributes such as _name_, _username_, and _password_. Each **_User_** can be associated with multiple **_Devices_**. The **Dataset** class represents a collection of data that describes the user's typing style. It has attributes such as _reference phrase_ that the user has to type and _typing statistics_ that the system uses to verify the user's identity. The **Login** class has attributes such as _time stamp_ and _success/failure status_. Each **_Login_** is associated with one **_User_**. The **Keyboard** class has attributes such as _key layout_ and _typing speed_. Each **_Keyboard_** can be associated with multiple **_Devices_**. The **Device** class represents the different devices that users can use to log in to their accounts, such as desktop computers, laptops, and mobile phones. The **Device** class has the attributes _device type_ such (e.g. desktop, laptop, mobile), _operating system_, and _compatibility_ with TypeLock. The **_Device_** class is associated with the **_User_** class through the act of being used by the user to log into their account. Additionally, each **_Device_** can be associated with multiple **_Users_** and can be used for multiple **_Logins_**. The **TypeLock** class is the main class that controls the system's functionality. It contains the algorithms that analyze the user's typing style, compare it to the _data_ in the **Dataset**, and determine whether to _grant access_ to the user's account. The **Back-end** class has the attributes of _typing biometrics_ and _dataset compilation_. The **_Back-end_** class is associated with the **_Front-end_** class through the act of receiving input from the user and sending output to the user. The **Front-end** class has the attributes of _user interface_ and _prompt_ for the _reference phrase_. The **_Front-end_** class is associated with the **_Client-Server_** class through sending user input to the **_Back-end_** class for processing. The **Client-Server** class has the attribute of _partitioned sections_ for the back-end and front-end. The **_Client-Server_** class is associated with the **_Back-end_**, **_Front-end_**, and **_Device_** classes through the act of processing and sending information between the classes. Finally, the **Reference Phrase** class represents the passphrase that is generated by the **Front-end** class for the user to type. It has the attribute of _passphrase_ which is a moderate-length string. The **_Reference Phrase_** class is associated with the **_User_** class through the process of being typed by the user to create or verify their typing style dataset. Overall, TypeLock uses these classes and their associations to provide a secure and user-friendly login method that eliminates the need for users to remember multiple passwords. By identifying users based on their unique typing style, the system offers a convenient and efficient alternative to traditional password-based authentication methods.
