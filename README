Product Name:

Summary: TypeLock is a convenient security protocol that replaces the standard user/password system. TypeLock allows you to log into your accounts using your own typing style instead of one of the hundreds of passwords you maintain and memorize. 

Client Value: TypeLock is a convenient alternative to memorizing all of your passwords for your different accounts. With our new technology, we can use your personal typing style to identify if the user trying to log into the account is in fact you! No longer, will you have to create documents to house your passwords for each of your individual accounts. Instead, you can type out a brief, provided paragraph to determine if you are you!

Features: Biometric type style measurements that compare input against database system metrics.

Limitations: Cross device accessability. We don't currently know how this would be implemented across devices like laptop/tablets/smart phones
